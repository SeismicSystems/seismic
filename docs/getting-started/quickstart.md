# Quickstart

You can play around with `stype` using our [starter repository](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-starter). This assumes you went through everything in [Installation](installation.md).

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>git clone "https://git@github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-starter.git"
</strong><strong>cd seismic-starter/packages/contracts
</strong><strong>sforge test -vv
</strong></code></pre>

Or if you prefer a more detailed walkthrough of building on Seismic, check out our [Tutorials](../tutorials/table-of-contents.md) section.
