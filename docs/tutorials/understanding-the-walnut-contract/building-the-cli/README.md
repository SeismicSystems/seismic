# Interacting with the contract via a CLI

In this section, you will write a CLI to interact with the deployed Walnut smart contract from scratch, simulating a multiplayer, multi-round game consisting of two players, Alice and Bob. At the end of this section, you will be able to see a full game play out on your local Seismic node! _Estimated time: \~30 minutes_
