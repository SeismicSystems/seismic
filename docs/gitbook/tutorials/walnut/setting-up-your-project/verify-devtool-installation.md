# Verify devtool installation

Before continuing, ensure that you have completed the steps in the [Installation](../../../../getting-started/installation.md) section to install all necessary Seismic developer tools:

• `sforge`: Framework for testing and deploying smart contracts.

• `sanvil` : Local Seismic node.

• `ssolc`: The Seismic Solidity compiler.

Run each of the above commands in your terminal with a `--version` flag to ensure that they're installed correctly.

Also ensure that you have [bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your machine. If you do not have `bun` installed, follow the instructions [here](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) to install it on your machine.
