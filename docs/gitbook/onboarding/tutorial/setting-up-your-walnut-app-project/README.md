# Setting Up Your Walnut App Project

In this chapter, you’ll set up the foundation for the Walnut App using a clean and modular monorepo-style workspace. This structure separates concerns into distinct areas, making your project easier to navigate and maintain. You’ll create a `contracts`  directory to house your Seismic smart contracts and tests, and a `cli`  directory to serve as the command-line interface for interacting with those contracts. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a fully initialized project, complete with dependencies, formatting tools, and a seamless environment for both contract development and interaction.
