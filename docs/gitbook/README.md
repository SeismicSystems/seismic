### What is Seismic?

Seismic is a privacy enabled blockchain for fintechs. The blockchain is EVM, so developer experience is approximately the same as Ethereum, with a bit of extra syntax to control privacy settings.&#x20;

It also comes with additional modules commonly needed by fintechs, such as compliance tooling and on-/off-ramps.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Seismic can help you build crypto powered products while protecting the privacy of your users.
