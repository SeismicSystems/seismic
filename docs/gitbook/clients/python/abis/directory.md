# Directory

## Constants

```python
DIRECTORY_ADDRESS: str = "0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000004"
DIRECTORY_ABI: list[dict[str, Any]]
```

`DIRECTORY_ABI` is exported for completeness.

Directory interactions are internal to the SDK's SRC20 helper flows and are intentionally not documented in this public reference.
